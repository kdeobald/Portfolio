        <p class="project-p">For this project, the course goal was a landing page but this did not fit with my learning goals at the time so I did a parody store landing page instead. I wrote all the copy and did all the UI design in Figma, then recreated it within the limitations of what I could achieve without any Javascript in the Free Code Camp editor.</p>

        <p class="project-p">I am a huge nerd, so for this project I wanted to make a wiki entry about Kirk, but done with the UI style used on all the touch screens from Star Trek: The Next Generation.</p>

        <p class="project-p">Given the volume of data I wanted to put in just for the practice, I stuck pretty close to requirements for this one as well. All text content was copied from the course example, but the code is my own.</p>
